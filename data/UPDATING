USPA conveniently numbers their meets and hosts results in a single location:
  http://uspla.org/home/competition-results

New instructions (using the automatic scripts):

To import a modern meet:
  1. Run ./uspa-fetch to fetch all missing meets.
  2. Run `ls fetch/` to list all missing meets.
  3. Pick a meet by number, for example '0586'.
  4. Run `./helper 0586` to pull that meet from fetch into a new folder.

If helper failed, the meet could not be automatically imported. At that point,
a number of temporary files will be left in the meet folder (e.g., '0586').

You will have to manually fix the files (or the scripts to read them).
To do that, the pipeline (as run by `uspa-parse`) is as follows:
  1. uspa-pdf-to-bbox converts 0586.pdf to 0586.html with bounding box information.
  2. uspa-bbox-to-csv converts 0586.html to 0586.csv with text arranged by row.
  3. uspa-csv-to-final converts 0586.csv to entries.csv by understanding row data.

================================

Old instructions (using manual column alignment in a text file):

To convert an old (but still post-2010 or so) meet result spreadsheet PDF to CSV:
  1.  Create a folder named after the unique meet number.
  2.  Download the results PDF into that folder.
  3.  Run `pdftotext -layout *.pdf`.
  4.  Rename the output text file to original.txt
  5.  Delete the original PDF file.
  6.  Manually edit original.txt to vertically align columns.
  7.  From within the folder, run ../uspatocsv-old original.txt, changing original.txt until it passes.
  8.  Redirect the output of `../uspatocsv-old original.txt` as entries.csv.
  9.  Manually create meet.csv using the header in original.txt.
  10. Add the new folder to git and push.

With regard to the Wilks column, USPA sometimes publishes scores marked Wilks
that include the McCulloch age coefficient. These scores should be treated as
incorrect and fixed, since Wilks and McCulloch are separately tracked.
