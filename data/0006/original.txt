Mountain High School in Frazier Park, California. It was a great venue and we really
appreciate everything the school staff did for us. We had a great meet with a lot of first-
time lifters who we hope to see competing at future events. Overall, twenty-eight records
were set or broken at this meet. Thanks go out to our referees Victor Elliott, Gretchen
Buerki, Jack Hughes, Roger Bolton, Gary Ridgeway and Lisa Denison. Thanks also to
our scorekeeper, Krishna Kostas and her sons Ian and Kellen for all of their hard work.
We’d also like to thank our sponsors, Inzer Advanced Designs, Wright’s Power
Promotions and Wheeler’s Fitness Equipment. (Results: Steve Denison)
