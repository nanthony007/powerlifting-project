(*) Denotes California State Single Lift Record (!) Denotes American Single Lift record. The meet was
held outside at Los Alisos Middle School in Norwalk, CA. It was a wonderful venue and the great weather
was a bonus. Multiple CA State record holder, Bob Seibold, held a very informative seminar on bench
pressing before the contest got under way. His good-natured attitude and helpful insights were greatly
appreciated. The women got things rolling with Lynda Stark setting a new state record in the Master 45-
49, 148 lb weight class. Mary Pennington was strong with a new submaster record in the 181 lb class. It
was a pleasure to see Vicky Hembree, who struggled a little, missing her first two attempts. She came back
and got her third at 292 lb then went on to a fourth attempt, with a solid 303. CA State open, submaster and
an American record in one day, not too bad! Scott Layman made the trip from Bakersfield and won the
148lb class and Best Lifter-lightweight men (114 to 181). Steve Kato was impressive (and raw) setting a
new submaster record in the 148lb class. Kingston Lee edged out fellow competitors in the 181 lb class for
the win. Bob Dunham tied the CA state record in the 242 lb class. He tried to break it on a fourth attempt,
but didn’t quite make it. Art Thompson cruised by fellow 275ers Leonard Coaston and co-meet director,
Steve Denison, with a massive 545.5 bench, setting a CA state record in the masters 40-49 division. He
also took home the Best Lifter-Heavyweight (198 to 308+) award. John Wooner set a CA state record in
the 308 submaster division, but the 308 open class belonged to Brian Meek. With a 485 lb bench, Brian set
a new CA state master 50-54 record and an American record as well. The winner in the 308+ open was Big
“O” Walker, with a nice 457.25 on his third attempt. Larry Hedrick set a new CA state record in the master
50-59 division. After the sanctioned competition, we had some teenage lifters from local schools compete.
We hope that they too have been “bitten by the iron bug” and we look forward to seeing them compete in
Powerlifting events in the future. We’d like to thank the Outback Steakhouse for coming out and providing
a great burger deal to the athletes and spectators. We’d like to acknowledge those who contributed to
making this meet a success: Our referees; Fran Haley, Don Haley, Victor Elliott, Kelli LaMantia and Lisa
Denison. Scott Layman, Eric Thorn and Jim Merlino also helped to referee the teenage lifters. Our deep
appreciation goes to our co-meet director, Chris Kostas and once again, his lovely wife Krishna for her
flawless scorekeeping. We’d also like to thank Brian Pfiffner and Shane Toal for spotting and loading.
Not to mention Chuck LaMantia who made most of the arrangements to make this meet happen, as well as
his entertaining announcing. Kevin Meskew even took a turn on the mike! A big “Thank You” goes out to
everyone at Los Alisos Middle School for all of their help. And last, but not least, our sponsors: Wright’s
Power Promotions, The Deep Tissue Center, Digital Disc Jockeys, House of Pain Ironwear,
Powerlifter Video Magazine, US Army Recruiting Station, Inzer Advance Designs, Ascending
Awards, The American Eagle Bodybuilding Gym and Outback Steakhouse. It was an outstanding
meet. Woo Woo!! Results-Lisa Denison.
