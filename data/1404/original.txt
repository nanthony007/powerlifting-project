The inaugural Southern States Special Olympics Open was held at the Desoto Athletic Club in Southaven, Mississippi on March 23, 2019. The first USPA meet of
its kind in the area brought in gifted athletes from several surrounding states. The group ranged from veteran lifters to first time competitors.

The female lifters Kourtney Krebs, Lauren Smith and Laura Moore lit up the platform with their bright smiles and their enthusiasm. The Menâ€™s Open Push/Pull Raw
was the most highly contested division with experienced lifters Isaiah Newson, Dewitt Wright, Isaiah Wright and Steven Davis all looking for that Best Lifter Award.
Teddy Underwood had the biggest Bench Press in that division and Seth Slocum had the biggest Deadlift but Kyle Krebs, with some solid lifting, walked away with
the best Wilks score. Nico Cruz-Uribe from Tuscaloosa struggled on the squat but persevered and came back to earn a sizeable Push/Pull total and a PR. There
were several Submasters competing including John T. Farley, Richard Mellon, Greg Standard and first time competitor Andrew Richardson. All of them impressed
the audience with their intensity and focus.

Our Masters Full Power lifters Kevin Rankin and Chad Quinton were exceptional in their technique and both had a great day. Coming back from an injury, Jesse
Wims was relegated to Bench Only but easily set a State record in his division. Also returning from an injury, Duane Hudson managed to post some hefty numbers
in the Bench Only and Push/Pull divisions. Seasoned lifter, Greg Thiel worked the crowd and ended the day with some excellent numbers.

Our two lightest competitors Ethan Artrip and Alex Hannah, showed that good things come in small packages putting up some big numbers in Push/Pull. Overall
everyone had a good time and we plan to hold this again next year. Thank you to the lifters for coming out.

Thank you to the Special Olympics organization for helping to promote this meet. Thank you to the Desoto Athletic Club for hosting this event. We could not have
had a better host. Thank you to the Coaches who work with these lifters every day. Thank you to the parents and family members of these athletes for supporting
them in their lifting endeavors. Thank you to all of my volunteers who traveled to North Mississippi at their own expense. I look forward to watching this meet grow.
