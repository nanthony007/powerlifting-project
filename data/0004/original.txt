Men- Light – Scott Layman, Best Lifter Men- Heavy – Jesse Branham. This year’s
USPF CA State Championships were held at the Best Western Hotel in Bakersfield, CA.
We had a well-run meet, and everyone had a great time. Our Special Olympic lifters,
Matt Prinster and Kevin Ezell once again displayed their commitment and enthusiasm for
the sport. They lifted very well and really had the crowd behind them. In her first full
Powerlifting meet, sixteen year-old Priscilla Sanchez was very impressive setting state
and personal records. A dedicated lifter, she left the meet and still managed to make it to
her prom on Saturday night! Co-meet director, Lisa Denison won the women’s 148lb
class with a PR squat, deadlift and total. She also took home the Best Lifter award for the
women. Mary Pennington won the 181s and continues to improve. Disa Hatfield had her
team cheering her on as she won the 198lb class. Saturday’s competition also included
the Men classes 132 to 181. Andrew Lopez, the lone competitor in the 132lb submaster
class, struggled a little with the squat then came back and went 5 for 6 in the bench and
deadlift, setting state records in the process. Scott Layman impressed the crowd with
some monster lifts. Missing his first 540lb attempt in the squat, he came back and nailed
his second to get in the meet. He ended the day with a 529lb deadlift, went home with
the Best Lifter-Light award and came back on Sunday to take the CA state referee test.
Steve Kato won the submaster 148lb class and set a state record with a 303lb bench.
Feeling a little under the weather didn’t stop 13 year-old John Cano. He displayed
incredible determination and went home with state records. The 181 lb 55-59 class
belonged to Edwin Hill. He inspired us all by going 8 for 9 in his first full competition.
The men’s 198 to 308+ class competition took place on Sunday. Michael Brown put up
some big numbers in the submaster 198lb class, but it was Paul Kelley who took home
the win. Paul had a great day, setting a state record with a 363.75 bench. Lord Elliott
had a 9 for 9 day and set state junior records in the 220lb class for the squat and total.
John Bostick took second place in the 220lb class showing a true competitive spirit with
an impressive 661 deadlift. Jesse Branham went for 705 on his third attempt in the squat,
but had to settle for 677.75. He took home the win for the 220lb class and Best Lifter-
Heavy as well. Ruben Arredondo won the 220lb 45-49 class with a 1300 total. Five
lifters competed in the 242lb open class. Steve Landry took home the honors, with a
fierce effort and his family cheering him on. UCLA strength coach, Darin Lovat made a
comeback to the platform and lifted well taking second place. Both Brad Trujillo and
Bill McCaslin dropped a weight class since last year’s state meet, and had good numbers
to show for it. Kevin Westbrook had an 8 for 9 day and also lifted well. Delmer Brown
won the 242lb 45-49 class and Steve Hallman took the 242lb 50-54 trophy. First time
competitor, Andrew Austin took home the win in the 275lb class. We’re looking forward
to some big lifting in the future from this guy. Frequent bench press competitor, Kenneth
Scott proved that he’s got what it takes for a full meet too with a win in the 275lb 40-44
class. Clinton Haflich had trouble with depth on the squat, but we’re sure to see him
again. Making a comeback to three-lift competition, Danny Herrera set a state record
with a 369.25 bench in the 275lb 60-64 class. After taking the CA state referee test on
Saturday, Gary Ridgeway came back on Sunday and won the 275lb 45-49 class. Once
again, “The legend of George Brink” (just kidding George) wowed the crowd with his
outstanding lifting. He set state records in the deadlift and total. He set an American
record in the 308lb master 50-54 class with a 777lb deadlift, and went for 804 on a fourth
attempt, but it was just a little too much for him. Huge thanks go out to our referees:
Don Haley, Fran Haley, Vic Elliott, Ken Wheeler, Roger Bolton, Kevin Meskew, Steve
Denison, Lisa Denison, Kelli La Mantia and Chris Kostas. Spotters/Loaders: Joe Jano,
Warren Woolsey and Steve Elisondo. Scorekeepers: Krishna Kostas and Kelli La
