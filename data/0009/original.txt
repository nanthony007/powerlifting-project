            *American record, $State record, Best Lifters were Mary Jacobson—Women’s Division,
            Pat McNeil—Submaster Men, Robert Cortes—Master light, & Willie Kindred-Heavy.
            The USPF Submaster and Master Nationals in Las Vegas was a fine exhibition of
            strength and power. We appreciate all those lifters that were able to come out and lift
            during the Mother’s Day weekend. Even though the numbers were down, the lifting was
            spectacular. There were two American Records set in two different weight classes and
            age groups. First off, Robert Cortes broke all the American records in the 148 lb class 70-
            74 age group while Bill Johnson broke the American squat record in 198 lb class 50-54
            age group. Congratulations to both of these gentlemen. Especially significant is the fact
            that Robert Cortes just competed a week earlier at the USAPL Master Nationals in Texas
            and took first in his weight class there. Robert brought many of his family members to
            Vegas to cheer him on and support him. He has had many great years of lifting and still
            has many more. Robert Cortes set his first state record in the early 80’s while in the 45-49
            age group. He has American and state records in 45-49, 54-54, 55-59, 60-64, 65-69, and
            now 70-74. All records have been set in the 148 lb weight class. That is incredible to be
            able to set that many records and be able to stay in the same weight class for over 20
            years of competitive lifting. Congratulations to Robert for being a true die hard
            champion. Bill Johnson was our other American record breaker in the 198 class, 50-54
            age group. Bill successfully squatted 633 lbs breaking the old squat record of J.B. Adams
            who set the record at 628 lbs in the squat back on May 14, 1988. Congratulations to Bill

Johnson for his fine efforts in breaking this 13 year record. Since I am the California state
chairman, I am also recognizing those lifters who broke state records. If there are other
state records from outside California that were broken, please get a hold of your state
chairman with these results or have him or her contact me. Mary Pennington set all the
California state submaster women’s records with a squat of 148 lbs, bench of 176 lbs,
deadlift of 253 lbs, and a total of 578 lbs. Congratulations to Mary for her fine efforts on
the platform. Richard Cirigliano broke Gordon Santee’s 1992 California state deadlift
record in the 165 class, 45-49 age group with a 600 lb pull. Congratulations to Richard!
Pete Wilson broke three California state records in the 198 class, 60-64 age group with a
451 squat, 347 bench, and a 1223 lb total. Pete also holds the California state records in
the 198 class 55-59 age group in the squat, bench, and total that he set back in 1994.
Congratulations to Pete! I want to thank all those individuals who helped support our
meet. Thanks to my good friends Jesse Branham and Brad Trujillo from Grand Junction,
CO who came over to help spot and load. Thanks to John Bostick and Andrew Austin
from Palmdale, CA who also came over to Vegas to help spot and load. These four
individuals were the best spotter/loaders that a meet director would want. They did an
outstanding job and we really appreciate their efforts. We also would like to thank Scott
Layman for his help with the scoreboard, spotting/loading, and being the platform
manager at times. I want to thank my parents, Smokie and Twila Denison for being at the
meet to help support me by taking care of the Door and handling the Inzer table. Thanks
to my niece Rachel Mishra, who is from Vegas and made it over to be my expeditor for
the meet. She did a really fine job and I really appreciate her taking the time to support
our meet.. We want to thank our various International and national judges starting with
Jan and Linda Shendow, Dave Jeffrey, Gordon Santee, Bud Mucci, Jim and Ann Wright,
and of course my fine wife Lisa Denison who helped judge and announce. We also want
to thank Chris Kostas for announcing and Krishna Kostas for running the score table.
Thanks to Chris Kostas and Wright’s Power Promotions for the platform and warm-up
equipment. Thanks to Chuck LaMantia for the use of his sound equipment. Thanks to
Gene Estrada and Estrada’s Gym in San Luis Obispo, CA for the use of his electric
squat racks, and digital clock. Thanks to Eddie Haflich of Strength and Health Barbell
Club in Bakersfield, CA for the use of his warm-up weights. Finally we want to thank
our sponsors for their monetary help, gift certificates and equipment. We would like to
give special thanks to Ergogen Labs, Inzer Advance Designs, Topper Supply
Company, METRX, House of Pain Iron Wear, Digital Disc Jockeys, Crain’s
